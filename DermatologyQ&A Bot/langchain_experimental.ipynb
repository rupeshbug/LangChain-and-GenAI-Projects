      "In deep learning, an attention mechanism is a neural network technique that allows a model to selectively focus on specific parts of an input sequence or data structure. It helps the model prioritize relevant information and suppress irrelevant or less important information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How it Works:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Query:** The model generates a query vector, which represents the current state of its attention.\n",
      "2. **Key-Value Pairs:** The input sequence or data structure is represented as a set of key-value pairs. Each key corresponds to a specific item in the sequence, and the value contains the associated information.\n",
      "3. **Attention Scores:** The query vector is compared to each key using a scoring function (e.g., dot product, cosine similarity). This calculates an attention score for each key-value pair.\n",
      "4. **Weighted Sum:** The attention scores are normalized to create a probability distribution. These probabilities are used to weight the values associated with each key.\n",
      "5. **Attention Output:** The weighted values are summed to produce an attention output, which represents the model's focus on the relevant parts of the input.\n",

      "[Document(page_content='questions: What is psoriasis and what are its common symptoms?\\nanswer: Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that results in the overproduction of skin cells. This overproduction leads to patches of thick, red skin covered with silvery scales. Common symptoms include red patches of skin covered with thick, silvery scales, small scaling spots (commonly seen in children), dry and cracked skin that may bleed, itching, burning, or soreness, thickened, pitted, or ridged nails, and swollen and stiff joints.', metadata={'source': 'What is psoriasis and what are its common symptoms?', 'row': 0}), Document(page_content=\"questions: What is the etiology of acne?\\nanswer: Acne is primarily caused by the overproduction of oil; blocked hair follicles that don't allow oil to leave the pore, which may cause a clogged pore; bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes that can grow inside the hair follicles and cause inflammation; and hormonal changes, particularly during puberty and menstruation. Other factors like certain medications, diet, and stress can also contribute to the development of acne.\", metadata={'source': 'What is the etiology of acne?', 'row': 1}), Document(page_content='questions: What are the recommended medications for atopic dermatitis?\\nanswer: There are several medications available for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are often the first line of treatment. These can help to reduce inflammation and itching. Other options include topical calcineurin inhibitors, which affect the immune system and help to maintain normal skin texture and reduce flare-ups. In severe cases, systemic drugs that work throughout the body may be used. These include corticosteroids, but they are used sparingly because of potential side effects. Other systemic drugs include methotrexate, cyclosporine, and biologics.', metadata={'source': 'What are the recommended medications for atopic dermatitis?', 'row': 2}), Document(page_content=\"questions: Can you tell me about the treatment modalities for melanoma?\\nanswer: Melanoma treatment depends on the stage and location of the disease, as well as the patient's overall health. Options include surgery, which is the primary treatment for early-stage melanomas. In some cases, lymph nodes may also be removed. Other treatments include immunotherapy, which boosts the body's natural defenses to fight the cancer; targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells; chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells; and radiation therapy, which uses high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells. In some cases, a combination of these treatments may be used.\", metadata={'source': 'Can you tell me about the treatment modalities for melanoma?', 'row': 3}), Document(page_content='questions: What is rosacea and what are its common symptoms?\\nanswer: Rosacea is a common skin condition that causes redness and visible blood vessels in your face. It may also produce small, red, pus-filled bumps. The symptoms may flare up for a period of weeks to months and then diminish for a while. Common symptoms include facial redness, swollen red bumps, eye problems (many people with rosacea also experience dry, irritated, swollen eyes and red, swollen eyelids), and an enlarged nose (in rare cases, rosacea can thicken the skin on the nose, causing it to appear bulbous).', metadata={'source': 'What is rosacea and what are its common symptoms?', 'row': 4}), Document(page_content=\"questions: What causes seborrheic dermatitis?\\nanswer: The exact cause of seborrheic dermatitis is unknown, but it may be related to a yeast (fungus) called Malassezia that is in the oil secretion on the skin, or to an irregular response of the immune system. Other factors that may increase your risk of developing seborrheic dermatitis include certain neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, head injury or stroke, HIV/AIDS, alcoholism, depression, eating disorders, and certain medications.\", metadata={'source': 'What causes seborrheic dermatitis?', 'row': 5}), Document(page_content='questions: What are the recommended medications for treating vitiligo?\\nanswer: Treatment for vitiligo aims to stop or slow the progression of pigment loss and, if you desire, attempt to return some color to your skin. Medications include topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy. In some cases, tattooing small areas of skin may be recommended, especially if your complexion is very dark. Other treatments include removing the remaining color (depigmentation) or skin grafting.', metadata={'source': 'What are the recommended medications for treating vitiligo?', 'row': 6}), Document(page_content=\"questions: What are the treatment options for basal cell carcinoma?\\nanswer: Treatment options for basal cell carcinoma depend on the type, location, and size of the tumor, as well as the patient's overall health. Options include surgical excision, where the tumor along with a margin of normal skin is cut out; Mohs surgery, which involves removing the tumor layer by layer; curettage and electrodessication, where the tumor is scraped out and the base burned; radiation therapy, used when surgery isn't an option; topical treatments for very superficial basal cell carcinomas; and targeted drug therapy for advanced basal cell carcinoma.\", metadata={'source': 'What are the treatment options for basal cell carcinoma?', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content=\"questions: What is eczema and what are its common symptoms?\\nanswer: Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a condition that makes your skin red and itchy. It's common in children but can occur at any age. Eczema is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare periodically. Common symptoms include dry skin, itching, which may be severe, especially at night, red to brownish-gray patches, especially on the hands, feet, ankles, wrists, neck, upper chest, eyelids, inside the bend of the elbows and knees, and in infants, the face and scalp, small, raised bumps, which may leak fluid and crust over when scratched, and thickened, cracked, scaly skin.\", metadata={'source': 'What is eczema and what are its common symptoms?', 'row': 8}), Document(page_content='questions: What causes contact dermatitis?\\nanswer: Contact dermatitis is caused by a direct reaction to something that irritates the skin or triggers an allergic reaction. The substance could be one of thousands of known allergens and irritants. Some of the most common are soaps, cosmetics, fragrances, jewelry containing nickel, cleaning products, certain plants, and latex gloves. Some people develop allergic reactions to tattoo ink, resulting in an itchy rash at the tattoo site.', metadata={'source': 'What causes contact dermatitis?', 'row': 9}), Document(page_content='questions: What are the recommended medications for treating hives?\\nanswer: Hives, also known as urticaria, are often treated with antihistamines. These medications can help to relieve itching and prevent new hives. Over-the-counter (OTC) versions include cetirizine (Zyrtec), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), and loratadine (Claritin). Prescription antihistamines that can be used include hydroxyzine (Vistaril) and cyproheptadine. In severe cases, oral corticosteroids such as prednisone may be prescribed. Other treatments include avoiding triggers, using cool compresses to soothe the skin, and wearing loose-fitting clothes.', metadata={'source': 'What are the recommended medications for treating hives?', 'row': 10}), Document(page_content=\"questions: What is the etiology of rosacea?\\nanswer: The exact cause of rosacea is unknown, but it's likely a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. A number of factors can trigger or worsen rosacea by increasing blood flow to the surface of your skin.

Medications can include topical drugs that reduce redness and inflammation, such as metronidazole, azelaic acid, and ivermectin. Oral antibiotics, like doxycycline, can help reduce inflammation and redness. In severe cases, isotretinoin may be used. Laser therapy can help reduce redness in persistent cases. Lifestyle changes, such as avoiding triggers, using sunscreen, and practicing good skin care, can also help manage symptoms.', metadata={'source': 'What are the treatment options for rosacea?', 'row': 12}), Document(page_content='questions: What are the treatment modalities for acne?\\nanswer: Acne treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Mild acne can often be managed with over-the-counter products containing ingredients like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. For moderate to severe acne, prescription medications may be necessary. These can include topical treatments such as retinoids and antibiotics, or oral medications like antibiotics, combined oral contraceptives, anti-androgen agents, or isotretinoin. In some cases, therapies such as lasers and photodynamic therapy, chemical peels, or extraction of whiteheads and blackheads may be recommended.', metadata={'source': 'What are the treatment modalities for acne?', 'row': 13}), Document(page_content='questions: What are the treatment options for eczema?\\nanswer: Treatment for eczema aims to heal the affected skin and prevent flares. Common treatments include over-the-counter remedies, prescription topical medications, phototherapy, immunosuppressants, and biologic drugs. Over-the-counter treatments include hydrocortisone creams and ointments, which may help relieve itching and inflammation. Prescription creams and ointments containing corticosteroid, or drugs that control inflammation, are often recommended. In severe cases, your doctor may prescribe oral corticosteroids. Phototherapy, which involves exposure to controlled amounts of natural sunlight, can also be beneficial.', metadata={'source': 'What are the treatment options for eczema?', 'row': 14}), Document(page_content=\"questions: What causes melanoma?\\nanswer: Melanoma occurs when something goes wrong in the melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin — the pigment that gives your skin, hair and eyes color. The exact cause isn't clear, but exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds increases your risk of developing melanoma. Other factors that can increase your risk include having many moles or abnormal moles, a family history of melanoma, fair skin, a history of sunburn, living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation, and having a weak immune system.\", metadata={'source': 'What causes melanoma?', 'row': 15}), Document(page_content=\"questions: What is the etiology of atopic dermatitis?\\nanswer: Atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is a condition that makes your skin red and itchy. It's common in children but can occur at any age. The exact cause of atopic dermatitis is unknown, but it's likely due to a combination of dry, irritable skin, a malfunction in the body's immune system, and genetics. Environmental factors can also play a role. People with atopic dermatitis might have a higher risk of skin infections due to a weakened skin barrier.\", metadata={'source': 'What is the etiology of atopic dermatitis?', 'row': 16}), Document(page_content=\"questions: What are the symptoms of melanoma?\\nanswer: Melanoma signs include a new, unusual growth or a change in an existing mole. Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body, most often in areas that have had exposure to the sun. Common symptoms follow the ABCDE rule: Asymmetry (one half of the mole doesn't match the other), Border irregularity (the edges are ragged or notched), Color variations (having a variety of colors is a warning sign), Diameter (melanomas are usually larger in diameter than the eraser on your pencil, but they may be smaller when first detected), and Evolving (any change in size, shape, color, elevation, or another trait, or any new symptom such as bleeding, itching or crusting, may signal melanoma).\", metadata={'source': 'What are the symptoms of melanoma?', 'row': 17}), Document(page_content='questions: What are the symptoms of psoriasis?\\nanswer: Psoriasis typically presents as red patches of skin covered with thick, silvery scales. Other symptoms can include dry, cracked skin that may bleed, itching, burning or soreness, thickened, pitted, or ridged nails, and swollen and stiff joints. Psoriasis patches can range from a few spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions that cover large areas. Most types of psoriasis go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a time or even going into complete remission.', metadata={'source': 'What are the symptoms of psoriasis?', 'row': 18}), Document(page_content='questions: What is the etiology of melanoma?\\nanswer: Melanoma is caused by changes (mutations) in cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin responsible for skin color. These mutations can cause the cells to multiply rapidly and form malignant tumors. The primary environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, including sunlight and tanning beds, which can cause DNA damage in cells. Genetic factors, such as having a family history of melanoma and having certain gene mutations, can also increase risk.', metadata={'source': 'What is the etiology of melanoma?', 'row': 19}), Document(page_content='questions: What are the symptoms of rosacea?\\nanswer: Rosacea typically causes flushing (redness) of the skin, particularly on the face. Other symptoms can include visible blood vessels, swollen and sensitive skin, skin that stings or burns, dry and rough skin, raised red patches, thickened skin, and in some cases, eye problems like dryness and irritation, swollen eyelids, and cysts on the eyelids. Rosacea can also cause small, red, pus-filled bumps to develop.', metadata={'source': 'What are the symptoms of rosacea?', 'row': 20}), Document(page_content=\"questions: What are the recommended medications for treating psoriasis?\\nanswer: Psoriasis treatment typically aims to stop skin cells from growing so quickly and to remove scales. Topical treatments include corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, retinoids, calcineurin inhibitors, salicylic acid, coal tar, and moisturizers. Light therapy (phototherapy) is another option. For severe psoriasis or psoriasis not responsive to other treatments, drugs like methotrexate, oral retinoids, biologics, and cyclosporine may be prescribed. It's important to discuss these options with a healthcare provider to find the best treatment plan.\", metadata={'source': 'What are the recommended medications for treating psoriasis?', 'row': 21}), Document(page_content='questions: What causes atopic dermatitis?\\nanswer: Atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is caused by a combination of factors including genetics, an abnormal immune system, environment, activities that may cause skin to be more sensitive, and defects in the skin barrier that allow moisture out and germs in. People with atopic dermatitis often have allergies to things like certain foods, dust mites, or pollen. Stress and cold weather can also make symptoms worse.', metadata={'source': 'What causes atopic dermatitis?', 'row': 22}), Document(page_content=\"questions: What is the etiology of psoriasis?\\nanswer: Psoriasis is thought to be an immune system problem that causes the skin to regenerate at faster than normal rates. This results in the thick, silvery scales characteristic of psoriasis. Triggers for the disease can include infections, stress, cold weather, certain medications, trauma to the skin, and excessive alcohol consumption. There's also a genetic component, so if one or both of your parents have psoriasis, it's more likely you will too.\", metadata={'source': 'What is the etiology of psoriasis?', 'row': 23}), Document(page_content=\"questions: What are the typical symptoms of contact dermatitis?\\nanswer: Contact dermatitis is a skin rash caused by contact with a certain substance. Symptoms can include a red rash, itching, which may be severe, dry, cracked, scaly skin, bumps and blisters, sometimes with oozing and crusting, and swelling, burning or tenderness. The rash isn't contagious or life-threatening, but it can be very uncomfortable. Symptoms usually occur within a few hours or days of exposure to an allergen.\", metadata={'source': 'What are the typical symptoms of contact dermatitis?', 'row': 24}), Document(page_content='questions: What are the treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis?\\nanswer: Treatment for seborrheic dermatitis focuses on managing the symptoms and controlling flare-ups. Over-the-counter antifungal creams and shampoos containing ingredients like ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione, or selenium sulfide can be effective. Prescription-strength topical antifungals or steroids may be recommended for more severe cases. Additionally, medicated shampoos, creams, and lotions can help reduce inflammation and scale formation.
