This repository hosts a collection of projects based on LangChain, a framework for building applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) and various other GenAI technologies.

1. Gemini Chatbot & Chat with PDF: A general chatbot and a conversational AI that interacts with PDFs.
2. Dermatology Q&A Bot: An AI assistant for dermatology questions using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, leveraging an external knowledge base from a subset of the Dermatology Question-Answer Dataset.
